# Automating-Feature-Engineering
In this project, we present the Feature Engineering Machine (FEM), which automates the feature engineering process in classication and re-
gression problems. It is a meta-learning approach that learns from over a hundred meta-training datasets about the usefulness of a transformation
in enhancing the relationship between a feature and response variable to improve model performance. FEM is trained to provide the most suitable recommendations
for transforming the original features in a new dataset, based on learning from past feature engineering experiences.
